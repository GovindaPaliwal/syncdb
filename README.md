# ðŸ”¥ syncdb ðŸ”¥

syncdb syncs databases between two servers.

## Features

* Most common use case: Sync your production database to your local environment
* You also can sync between any servers, even from remote to remote (without local)
* Works with direct database connections or via ssh tunnels
* Currently supports mysql, postgresql support will be added soon
* Has also a fast mode where the sql file is zipped
* Does include a search/replace mechanism called [magicreplace](https://github.com/vielhuber/magicreplace)
* (Remote) commands like mysqldump, mysql, zip, e.g. can be overwritten manually to fit any environment
